# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project tracks global COVID-19 data including cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time using Python and real-world datasets.

## Objectives

- Import and clean COVID-19 global data
- Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
- Compare metrics across countries/regions
- Visualize trends with charts and maps
- Communicate findings in a Jupyter Notebook

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run the Project

1. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells from top to bottom.
3. All outputs including charts and maps will be displayed.

## Insights & Reflections

- India had the highest total COVID-19 cases among selected countries.
- Kenya recorded fewer cases and deaths.
- Death rates and vaccination progress vary across regions.
- The choropleth map reveals global disparities in case distribution.
